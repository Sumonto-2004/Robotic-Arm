## Overview

This project features a 3D model of a **robotic arm** designed using **SolidWorks**. The design simulates a multi-joint robotic manipulator, similar to those used in manufacturing and automation industries. It is ideal for educational demonstrations, simulation tasks, and can serve as a foundation for further development in robotics.

## Features

- Fully articulated robotic arm with multiple degrees of freedom.
- Modeled and assembled using SolidWorks 2021.
- Designed with motion simulation capabilities.
- Modular components for easy modification and scalability.
- Custom end-effector attachment (can be replaced with tools such as grippers, pens, etc.).
